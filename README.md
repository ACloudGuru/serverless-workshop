# A Cloud Guru: Serverless Workshop

In this workshop, we build a completely serverless video sharing web-site, complete with:

 - User authentication
 - Large file video uploads
 - A transcoding pipeline, that transcodes uploaded videos to web-friendly 480p mp4 format
 - Push-based, event-driven updates to the web-site. Users see new videos automatically, no browser refreshes needed
 - The ability to play video files hosted on scalable cloud storage.

## Lessons

There are 5 lessons.

 - Lesson 1 - Create a serverless transcoding pipeline in AWS
 - Lesson 2 - Setup the web site & user authentication (Auth0)
 - Lesson 3 - Create an API in the AWS cloud & authenticate calls
 - Lesson 4 - Enable browser-based uploads of video files to S3
 - Lesson 5 - Connect firebase to list videos

## Get Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine (or download it as a ZIP file).

There is a folder for each lesson. Each lesson contains a PDF document of instruction on how to complete the lesson.

## Sample Video Files

In this workshop you'll need to upload videos to the cloud. Since videos can be large, we've trimmed some Hollywood movies trailers to about 5-10 seconds each, to keep the file size relative small:

## Our Book
[Serverless Architectures on AWS](https://www.manning.com/books/serverless-architectures-on-aws?a_aid=serverless-architectures-on-aws&a_bid=145280de) is our book that covers serverless architectures in more detail. It is a great companion to this course as it provides more depth to everything we have learnt today. It is recommended if you want to explore serverless architectures further.
